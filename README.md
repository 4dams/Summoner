# Is this program legal???

Okay, this is a little bit tricky... The developer of the main part of this program has gotten confirmation of this program by a rioter before. You can [click here to see the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4c78hh/i_wrote_a_legal_program_to_track_summoner_spells/d1g2dcu/).<br />
Since I have only fixed a few bugs of the past version, added a nice UI and added the newest champions, the base of the program remains the same and should therefor not break any other rules. </br >
Basically, it's the same as running an app on your phone for tracking cooldowns. You don't modify game files and you still have to enter the summoners manually. (type `/n ez f` for example)

# How do I run this?

To download and run the program, please head over to the releases page of this repository. </br >
You can find all releases and versions of the program here: [Releases Page](https://github.com/4dams/Summoner/releases) </br >
**There may be some issues with anti viruses false detecting. You can see the full source code here on github and verify yourself that there isn't and malware or other stuff integrated in the program.** If you still don't trust me, you can also compile the program yourself.
