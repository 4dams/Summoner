# Is this program legal???

Okay, this is a little bit tricky... The developer of the main part of this program has gotten confirmation of this program by a rioter before.<br />

Since I have only fixed a few bugs of the past version, added a nice UI and added the newest champions, the base of the program remains the same and should therefor not break any other rules.

# How do I run this?
