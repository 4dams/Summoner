A small application designed for tracking the enemies' summoner spell cooldown in League of Legends using short ingame chat commands and a clean user interface. :+1:

- [Ingame Preview](https://i.4da.ms/96bb07d.gif)

# What has changed since the main version?

- [x] Fixed a lot of bugs
- [x] Added a clean and nice ingame UI
- [x] Updated for all new released champions
- [x] Added a feature for typing role name instead of champ name

# What spells are accepted?

Once ingame, you can type `/n ashe f` for example so start tracking cooldown for Ashe's flash. </br >
You can use the name of every champion and then the first letter of every summoner spell.

- **`B`** for **B**arrier
- **`C`** for **C**leanse
- **`E`** for **E**xhaust
- **`F`** for **F**lash
- **`G`** for **G**host
- **`H`** for **H**eal
- **`I`** for **I**gnite
- **`T`** for **T**eleport

# How do I run this program?

To download and run the program, please head over to the releases page of this repository. </br >
You can find all releases and versions of the program here: [Releases Page](https://github.com/4dams/Summoner/releases) </br >
- ***There may be some issues with anti viruses false detecting. You can see the full source code here on github and verify yourself that there isn't and malware or other stuff integrated in the program.** </br >
If you still don't trust me, you can also compile the program yourself.*

# Is this program allowed by Riot Games?

Okay, this is a little bit tricky... The developer of the main part of this program has gotten confirmation of this program by a rioter before. You can [click here to see the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4c78hh/i_wrote_a_legal_program_to_track_summoner_spells/d1g2dcu/) by Riot Sargonas on Reddit.<br />
Since the base of the program remains the same, it should therefor not break any other rules. </br >
- *Basically, it's the same as running an app on your phone for tracking cooldowns. You don't modify game files and you still have to enter the summoners manually. (type `/n ez f` for example)*
